# Milestones

This folder tracks project milestones - time-boxed development phases with clear deliverables.

## Milestone Lifecycle

```
Draft → Active → Complete → Archived
```

- **Draft**: Planning phase, scope not finalized
- **Active**: Currently being worked on
- **Complete**: All deliverables verified
- **Archived**: Historical record

## Conventions

### Naming
- Files: `M{N}.md` (M1.md, M2.md, etc.)
- Titles: Short, action-oriented (e.g., "Core API Implementation")

### Task Status
- `[ ]` - Not started
- `[~]` - In progress
- `[x]` - Complete

### Duration Guidelines
- Each milestone should be 1-4 weeks
- Longer efforts should be split into multiple milestones
